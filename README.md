Missing Features
Backend Integration: This application does not include a backend API to store or process user data. You will need to integrate a backend service to handle form submissions and store user data.
Form Validation: The application does not include form validation to ensure that users enter valid data. You will need to add validation logic to each component to prevent invalid submissions.
Error Handling: The application does not include error handling to handle unexpected errors or exceptions. You will need to add error handling mechanisms to provide a better user experience.
